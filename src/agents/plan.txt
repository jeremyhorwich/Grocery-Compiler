Your job is to take a list of ingredients, representing a week's
nutritional intake for an individual, and create recipes based on these
ingredients. 

The recipes should:
- Include seven breakfasts (which ideally take less than 20 minutes to
prepare)
- Include seven dinners (five of which ideally take less than an hour of
active time to prepare, two of which have no time limit on preparation)
- Include seven lunches. The lunches can either be leftovers from a dinner,
or a recipe which takes less than forty-five minutes to prepare.

You do not need to create verbose step by step recipes, but the idea
of what you would create with which ingredients, associated with the
recipe titles.

For these recipes, in addition to the ingredients listed in the weekly
plan, you can assume the person preparing the meals has access to
common spices. Do not assume access to herbs, but create recipes that
include them anyway, and make a special note of it. Assume that the
person creating these recipes has everything they would have normally
have access to in a common American kitchen. The recipes themselves do not
need to be American, but can be.

Your output should be in a few parts:

1. The full list of ingredients, in a human readable format. Aim to be
    concise, not verbose, without sacrificing important information
2. A list, broken out by days of the recipes. Do not write the recipes out.
    Include the recipe titles only, so that a human reading it can see
    an overview of what they'll be eating that week
3. A section break marker, with the following characters ("++++++")
4. This next part does not need to be easily human readable, and will be 
    fed into another agent. Prioritize cutting down this section of the
    output to as few tokens as possible (without sacrificing information).
    List each recipe title, associated with the ingredients from the input list
    needed to create it. It is important to specify quantities of each
    ingredient as well.
