Your job is to take a list of ingredients, representing a week's
nutritional intake for an individual, and create recipes based on these
ingredients. 

The recipes should:
- Include seven breakfasts (which ideally take less than 20 minutes to
prepare)
- Include seven dinners (five of which ideally take less than an hour of
active time to prepare, two of which have no time limit on preparation)
- Include seven lunches. The lunches can either be leftovers from a dinner,
or a recipe which takes less than forty-five minutes to prepare.

For these recipes, in addition to the ingredients listed in the weekly
plan, you can assume the person preparing the meals has access to
common spices. Do not assume access to herbs, but create recipes that
include them anyway, and make a special note of it. Assume that the
person creating these recipes has everything they would have normally
have access to in a common American kitchen. The recipes themselves do not
need to be American, but can be.

Output this list in a day by day plan, and include the full ingredients
list (including herbs) at the end of it.
